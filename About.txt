Monthly Expenditure Analysis involves reading a CSV file containing expense data and performing various tasks to analyze the data. Here's a brief explanation of how the analysis works and the tasks performed:

Reading CSV File:

A CSV file (e.g., expense_data_1.csv) containing monthly expenditures is read using Pythonâ€™s csv.DictReader(). Each row in the file represents a transaction with fields such as Date, Category, Amount, and Currency (INR).
Tasks Performed: The program performs 10 different tasks to analyze the data:

Print First 5 Rows:
Displays the first 5 transactions to give an overview of the data.

Create and Print Tuples of Dates and Categories:
Extracts all the dates and categories from the transactions and creates tuples, which are then printed.

Find Maximum and Minimum Transaction Amounts:
Finds and prints the highest and lowest amounts spent during the month.

Count Transactions by Category:
Counts the number of transactions in each category (e.g., Groceries, Utilities) and prints the result.

Print Unique Categories:
Identifies and prints all unique expense categories from the dataset.

Print Unique Dates:
Prints all the unique dates when the transactions were made, excluding time information.

Total Amount for a Specific Category:
Allows the user to specify a category and calculates the total expenditure in that category.

Transactions Above a Certain Amount:
Finds and prints all transactions where the amount exceeds a user-defined value.

Total Amount of All Transactions:
Sums up the total expenditure for the entire dataset.

Average Amount of All Transactions:
Calculates and prints the average amount spent per transaction.
